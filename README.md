## The Assignment
Create a command line application where a user can enter members of their team, answer some questions about them, and recieve at the end an HTML page with all the team members' information.

## Looking Forward
I definitely would like to clean up the CSS. I know it could look nicer.

## Installation

Download the repository from GitHub. Make sure you have node.js installed as well.

## Usage

Open the repo in your terminal. Enter "node index.js" & answer all the prompts. When finished entering team members, HTML page will be generated.

## Demonstration

There is an mp4 version of this walkthrough in the /assets folder of this repo. In the /dist folder, you can find a sample HTML file generated with the application.

## Credits

I was helped in this assignment by my TA Ryan Skog in our tutoring session.
